TCP Client sends binary to server
    Client sends binary    foo
    ${message}=  Server receives binary
    Should be equal   ${message}   foo
    
TCP Server sends binary to client
    Server sends binary   foo
    ${message}=  Client receives binary
    Should be equal   ${message}  foo
    
Multiple UDP clients
    [setup]  Start two udp clients
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT}   name=ExampleServer
    Connect two clients    ${SERVER PORT}    ${SERVER PORT}
    Two clients send foo and bar
    Server 'ExampleServer' should get 'foo' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 1 PORT}'
    Server 'ExampleServer' should get 'bar' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 2 PORT}'

Multiple UDP servers
    [setup]  Start two udp clients
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT}    name=Server_1
    Start udp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT 2}  name=Server_2
    Connect two clients    ${SERVER PORT}    ${SERVER PORT 2}
    Two clients send foo and bar
    Server 'Server_1' should get 'foo' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 1 PORT}'
    Server 'Server_2' should get 'bar' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 2 PORT}'

Multiple TCP clients
    [setup]  Start two tcp clients
    Start tcp server    ${SERVER}    ${SERVER PORT}   name=ExampleServer
    Connect two clients and accept connections
    Two clients send foo and bar
    'Connection_1' on 'ExampleServer' should get 'foo' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 1 PORT}'
    'Connection_2' on 'ExampleServer' should get 'bar' from '${CLIENT}':'${CLIENT 2 PORT}'
